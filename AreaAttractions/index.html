              <p class="bio">Built by the British in the 1770s and named in honour of 
                <br>King George the Third, who ruled from 1760 to 1820, 
                <br>the fort is now home to the Tobago Museum which occupies what 
                <br>was once the Barrack Guard House. The Museum exhibits Amerindian 
                <br>artifacts, military relics, shells and documents from the colonial period.
                <br>The prisoner’s bell tank, barracks and officers mess are some
                <br> of the highlights of a walk around the grounds. But for
                <br> many it is the spectacular vistas that the fort's high perch
                <br> over Scarborough affords that makes this a must see destination.</p>
